Default Error Pages:

    Implement customizable default HTML error pages for common HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500).

Support for Additional HTTP Methods:
    POST Method:
        Handle form submissions and file uploads.
        Process the body of the request, store the data, and return appropriate responses.
    DELETE Method:
        Implement logic to delete specified resources on the server.
        Ensure proper validation and send appropriate responses (e.g., 200 OK, 204 No Content, 404 Not Found).

Body Size Limits (POST method, upload files requirement):

    Set a limit on the size of the request body to prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks. Respond with a 413 Payload Too Large status code for oversized requests.

Directory Listing:

    Implement functionality to list directory contents when a directory is requested, and no index file is present. Generate a dynamic HTML page listing the files and directories.

Redirections:

    Implement support for HTTP redirections (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found). Configure specific URIs or conditions to trigger a redirect response.

Content-Type Handling:

    Enhance content-type detection and response headers based on the file extension of the requested resource. Ensure proper MIME type is sent for various file types.

Enhanced Status Codes:

    Extend the current implementation to handle more HTTP status codes accurately, including but not limited to:
        201 Created
        202 Accepted
        204 No Content
        206 Partial Content
        301 Moved Permanently
        302 Found
        403 Forbidden
        500 Internal Server Error

Customizable Headers:

    Allow for additional headers to be set based on server configuration or specific request conditions, enhancing flexibility and control over responses.
